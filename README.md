# OpenDSP

OpenDSP is an open source, cross platform, C++ Implementation of common digital
signal processing algorithms.

## Disclaimer

This library is still a work in progress, but since it can already calculate
fast Fourier transforms of arbitrary sizes relatively quickly I am choosing to
make it public now because others may find it useful.

# Build Requirements

* CMake v3.14.0 (or later)
* C++11 compliant compiler (or later)
* Conan package manager v1.18.1 (or later)

# Dependencies

This project requires the Conan package manager to automatically manage all of
its dependencies. To install Conan see:
